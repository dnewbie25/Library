## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SASS for handling the CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript using classes and a OOP approach

### What I learned

Working with classes in Javascript was a really good challenge. Although it seemed daunting at first, after some flowcharts made by pen and paper it became a really comfortable and straightforward way to create the library. I realized why OOP became so popular and important in the industry.
